# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Working
This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: classes not being applied correctly.

The problem arises from an incorrect or missing import statement in your main JavaScript (or equivalent) file and also the configuration of your css file which will import the tailwind utilities.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect setup, resulting in Tailwind CSS classes not working. The `input.css` file shows how to properly import the classes.

## Solution
The `solution.js` file provides the correct setup, enabling the use of Tailwind CSS classes.
